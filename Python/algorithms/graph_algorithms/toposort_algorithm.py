'''Purpose: Orders vertices of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge u â†’ v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Type: Graph Algorithm

Use Cases: Task scheduling, course prerequisite ordering, build systems, etc.

Approach: We can implement Toposort using DFS:

For each unvisited node, perform a DFS.

After visiting all neighbors, push the node to a stack.

At the end, pop nodes from the stack to get the topological order.

Time Complexity: O(V + E)

Space Complexity: O(V)'''
